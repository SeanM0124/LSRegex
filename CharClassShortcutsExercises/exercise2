Test the pattern /\s...\s/ from the previous exercise
against this text (be sure to delete the previous text first):

Observe that one of the three-letter words in this text match the pattern; it also matches 2 3. Why is it that this pattern doesn't include the three-letter words Doc, red, box, or Hup, but it does match 2 3?

ans: Doc doesnt match since it doesnt follow whitespace. I assume it doesnt match red since the space prior to red is taken by big match. Box doesnt work since the char after it is not whitespace, same for Hup

2 3 matches since whitespace falls under any char


Doc in a big red box.
Hup! 2 3 4
