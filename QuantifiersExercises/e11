Challenge: Write a regex that matches lines of text that contain either 3 comma separated numbers or 6 or more comma separated numbers. Test your regex against these strings:


123,456,789,123,345
123,456,,789,123
23,56,7
13,45,78,23,45,34
13,45,78,23,45,34,56

ans: 

/(^(\d+,|\d){3}$|^(\d+,|\d){6,}$)/

/(^(\d+,){2}\d+$|^(\d+,){5,}\d+$)/

/^(\d+,){2}((\d+,){3,})?\d+$/
