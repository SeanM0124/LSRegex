Are /abc/i and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ equivalent regex? If not, how do they differ? Can you provide an example of a string that would match one of these regex, but not the other?

They are equivalant in what they will match.
They both will match with any variation of abc, and the case is irrelevant.

Test Cases:

abc
ABc
aBC
ABC
AAA
ABAA
ACBB
