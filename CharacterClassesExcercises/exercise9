Challenge: write a regex that matches a string that looks like a simple negated character class range, e.g., '[^a-z]'. (Your answer should match precisely six characters. The match does not include the slash characters.) Test it with these strings:

\[\^[a-zA-Z0-9]-[a-zA-Z0-9]\]


The regex /[^a-z]/i matches any character that is
not a letter. Similarly, /[^0-9]/ matches any
non-digit while /[^A-Z]/ matches any character
that is not an uppercase letter. Beware: /[^+-<]/
is at best obscure, and may even be wrong.
