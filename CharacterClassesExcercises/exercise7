Are /(ABC|abc)/ and /[Aa][Bb][Cc]/ equivalent regex? If not, how do they differ? Can you provide an example of a string that would match one of these regex, but not the other?

They are not equivalent. The first one will only match with either ABC or abc. The 2nd one will match with any variation of AbC, aBC, abc, aBc etc.

test cases:

abc
AbC
aBC
ABC
aac
aab
ababa
aBC
